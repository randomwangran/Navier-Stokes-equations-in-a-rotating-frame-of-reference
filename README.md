# Navier-Stokes-equations-in-a-rotating-frame-of-reference

@navidcy gave me some advices on the background of `shallow water
  dynamics`. The beautiful book by GEOFFREY K. VALLIS' book chapter 4
explains well on this topic.


# What is this?

I find [OpenFOAM](https://github.com/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-dev/tree/master/tutorials/incompressible/shallowWaterFoam) happens to have such a tutorial. So, I would like to
study OpenFOAM and the [issue](https://github.com/FourierFlows/GeophysicalFlows.jl/issues/172).
